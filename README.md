# terraform-aws-backup [![Codefresh Build Status](https://g.codefresh.io/api/badges/pipeline/cloudposse/terraform-modules%2Fterraform-aws-backup?type=cf-1)](https://g.codefresh.io/public/accounts/cloudposse/pipelines/5d9c0dd46d867eabdb30d36e) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-backup.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-backup/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision [AWS Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/backup), a fully managed backup service that makes it easy to centralize and automate
the back up of data across AWS services such as EBS volumes, RDS databases, DynamoDB tables, EFS file systems, and AWS Storage Gateway volumes.

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-backup/releases).



For a complete example on how to backup an Elastic File System (EFS), see [examples/complete]((examples/complete
)
